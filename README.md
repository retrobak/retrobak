# Hi there
ðŸ‘‹ I'm RetroBak. I'm a developer from the Netherlands. I'm a web developer from the Netherlands with a focus on (web)security for applications and websites. With all the changes and automations for hacking there is always a challenge to find in the code :)

# Languages
My focus is on web applications written in PHP/MySQL. Frontend languages such as html / javascript are also among the languages I come into contact with on a daily basis.

Languages: PHP 5.x - 7.x, MySQL, HTML, Javascript, XML and Json

Preferred Programs: PhpStorm, HeidiSQL, PuTTY and a random SCRUM board-thing
